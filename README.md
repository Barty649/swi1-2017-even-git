# swi1-2017-even-git

Main goal is to add a new text file and make small change in README.md

Remember how to update your repo from original repo:
`git fetch upstream` 
`git merge --ff-only upstream/master`
`git push`

* Create a new branch 

* Switch to a new branch

* Change your name in README.md to your GitHub nick and add a text file that has your school login as name and contains some random line

* Try those two commands `git diff` `git status` and write what they do in two sentences to your text file. 

* Add changed files 

  * `git add [file's path]`(may add multiple files at once) or `git add -A` (adds all changed files)

* Commit changes

  * `git commit -m "commit message"`

* Push your branch

  * `git push origin [branch's name]`

* Create a PR

  * Go to [upstream repo](https://github.com/RoadToSoftwareFactory/swi1-2017-even-git)
